                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Sanjana Roy, and I am a technology professional, cybersecurity enthusiast, and aspiring
                    author with a background in Computer Science and Technology Management, along with a minor in
                    Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. My interest in cybersecurity policy, risk assessment, and
                    AI-driven security solutions started from a personal experience that made me realize how crucial
                    digital security is in today’s world. Over time, I developed hands-on experience in automated
                    security testing, compliance frameworks, and cloud security, earning industry-recognized
                    certifications to further expand my expertise. My goal is to create practical security solutions
                    that protect individuals and organizations from cyber threats, while also contributing to the
                    broader field of cybersecurity governance.


                    Outside of my professional journey, I have a deep love for books and storytelling. I am currently
                    working on my first novel, where I weave together themes inspired by technology, human psychology,
                    and real-world experiences. Beyond writing, I enjoy horse riding, which has taught me both
                    discipline and freedom, much like the balance needed in cybersecurity and creative expression. In my
                    free time, I love experimenting in the kitchen, baking millet-based cakes and making herbal ice
                    creams with honey, combining healthy ingredients with creativity.


                    I also have a special appreciation for flowers not for plucking, but for admiring their natural
                    beauty. Their presence reminds me of the simple joys in life, teaching me to slow down and
                    appreciate the world around me. As a certified yoga practitioner, I believe in a holistic approach
                    to life, where personal well-being and professional growth go hand in hand.

                    For me, technology, writing, and wellness are not separate interests, but interconnected passions
                    that shape my perspective on life. I am always looking for ways to learn, grow, and challenge
                    myself, whether it's through exploring new cybersecurity strategies, writing thought-provoking
                    stories, or simply finding beauty in the small things around me
